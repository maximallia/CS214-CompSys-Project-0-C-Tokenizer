# CS214-CompSys-Project-0-C-Tokenizer

Summary:

In this assignment, you will practice programming with C pointers. Much of the pointer manip- ulation will come in the form of operating on C strings. A program that is at the base of every terminal, shell and interpreter is a tokenizer. For this assignment, you will write a tokenizer.

A tokenizer is a program that takes a single string of characters of an arbitrary length and breaks them up into types of inputs. For instance, the single string “blah 8 stuff 1.3” contains two 'word'-type inputs, an 'integer'-type input and a 'float'-type input. Your tokenizer's job will be to to take that string and break it up into each type of token, printing out each as it identifies them.

You will not know the length of the input string beforehand, so you will not know how much memory to allocate in your code to copy the input string. Since you do not know the length of the input string, you will not know the index of the string's last character. These are two fundamental issues you must consider.
